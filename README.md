## Introduction

Sillelien Configurator comes in three parts, a server, an editor and your clients. The server must stay at a fixed location and have a mapped volume onto the host, it manages a very simple git repository containing your configuration. The editor is a seperate image powered by [Codebox](http://codebox.io) which allows you to edit any of the files in the git repository. Finally you clients can then run a simple one line command to start getting updates from the server (into the /config directory).

## Quick Start


1) Deploy the server
 
2) Deploy the [Codebox](http://codebox.io) editor and visit the GUI

    http://{editor-ip}:8080
    
If you haven't supplied credential environment variables then you'll need to log in with username/password of insecure/insecure.    

Don't forget you need to **commit** then **push** changes for them to be sent to the server.

3) 

EITHER: On each client that uses configurator you need to name the link to the server as `scserver`. Install git in your client image and then make sure you run the following as a background daemon:

```bash
    curl http://${SCSERVER_PORT_1500_TCP_ADDR}:${SCSERVER_PORT_1500_TCP_PORT} | sh
```

OR: Just run this line on startup for static configuration.
 
```bash
    git clone git://${SCSERVER_PORT_9418_TCP_ADDR}:${SCSERVER_PORT_9418_TCP_PORT}/config /config
```    
    
And that's it, the directory /config will now contain any files you want to use to configure your Docker images.

You can get going straight away using the Deploy to Tutum button.
